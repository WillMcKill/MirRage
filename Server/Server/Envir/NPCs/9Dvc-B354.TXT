[Main]
You know, I'm already 90 years old and have lived here
all my life. If you want to know anything about the
island, feel free to ask me at any time.

 <ask/aboutlegend> about the local legend 
 <ask/aboutmob> about the monsters 
 <ask/aboutMu> about Bottomless Pit

[aboutlegend]
According to the legend, 1000 years ago there was an
epic war, to decide the fate of the world. It happened
right here on this island... The evil forces from their
dark, underground lair rose from the earth, using the
island as a channel to invade the world.

 <Next/legend-1>

[legend-1]
However, mighty heroes appeared, who bravely fought and
defeated the evil forces after many fierce battles. 
These heroes sealed the path that led to the gateway of
the evil.

 <Next/legend-2>

[legend-2]
Later, these heroes built a temple that consisted of a maze,
on the sealed path, to block its access; however, as time
passed, the temple became buried deep into the ground and
no trace of it can now be found.

 <Next/legend-3>

[legend-3]
What? Unbelievable you say? Ha ha ha...
Of course, that's why I told you it is a legend!

 <Close/Exit>


[aboutmob]
I believe that the monsters spotted recently must be
the ones mentioned in the legend. Otherwise, how can we
explain that such things exist in the world? 
I am sure, positive, that they are the ones once defeated 
by the legendary heroes, and are returning once more.

[mob]
It is the end of the world. The end, I tell you.... 
Why must something like this happen in the very twilight
of my life?\
What misfortune... what sadness... bah!

[aboutMu]
The "Bottomless Pit"? Now there's something I haven't
heard about in a very long time. It happened such a long
time ago, so the youngsters here do not know much about
this. Anyway, it is a true story.

 <Next/Mu-1>

[Mu-1]
Long ago, there was a pit somewhere in this island. 
Whenever strange sound echoed through the pit, 
people passing there nearby 
disappeared all and never returned. 
So it was called "Bottomless Pit. 
 <next/Mu-2>

[Mu-2]
Ah! one man.. there was one man 
who came back alive. He came back as covered 
all over with wounds and told us there is 
another world down there full of cruel monsters. 
He spoke some more gibberish 
we couldn't understand and died few days later. 
 <next/Mu-3>

[Mu-3]  
The frightened villagers could not bear any more 
and called a famous shaman for an exorcism. 
Maybe because of the exorcism or something 
else, never again we have experienced 
such indidents of people disappearing. 
<next/Mu-4>  

[Mu-4]
That's the story and already 70 years have 
passed since then. Now no one remembers 
where was the pit but it might appear again. 
Village elders, who are aware of the incidents, 
are anxious about that.
