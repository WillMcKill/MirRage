Oh! Welcome, What are you looking for?
There is a wide variety of useful goods here.
Please have a look.

[Buy]
Everything I sell here may look meagre but
they are all necessary things.
Ok, What do you want to buy?

<Back/Main>


[Sell]
Oh what a coincidence!
I was just about to order some more goods since
the stock is running low.
What do you want to sell?

<Back/Main>


[@talk]
This is such an isolated place - goods are usually scarce.
It's people like me who keep helping to maintain some prosperity
here by importing goods from outside. Heh heh heh..
