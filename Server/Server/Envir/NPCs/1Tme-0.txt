I will buy high quality for high price.
but if the meat is stained with soil or burned with fire
I'll buy it at low price.

[Meathelp]
Meat can be gained from Hens, deer, sheep, and wolves.
To get meat from any of the above, first of all kill the animal.
Once you have killed it, press the ALT button, while left clicking
on the dead body for a few seconds.
You should then see a piece of meat appear in your inventory.
Using magic to kill an animal burns the meat, reducing its quality to 0.
