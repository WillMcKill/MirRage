[Main]
I am the warden of this house teaching the apprentice
the rules and regulations to make them responsible members
of the community. You have nowhere else to deposit your belongings?
You can keep them here. We have many empty rooms nowadays
due to decreasing member of enrollment from Tao apprentices.

[Storage]
You want to keep your items here, Sir/Ma'am? Of course you can.
Please show me the items you want to deposit.
