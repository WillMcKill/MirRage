[Main]
I'm Sandford, the only potion dealer
and medical practitioner in this island.
Any trouble with your body?

[Buy]
Do you want to buy any drug? I used the local ingredients
for making them instead of the ones from the main land
but the effect will be almost the same.

[Sell]
Tell you I won't accept any left-over drug from you.
A drug get easily spoiled once the lid is taken off.

<back/Main>

[Talk]
Hmmm... Shall I add lots of preservatives to that?...
