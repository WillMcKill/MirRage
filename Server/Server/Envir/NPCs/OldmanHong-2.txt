;================================================= =

[Main]
Hmm This isn't going to work!
Please help me with your power.
To tell you the truth,
for fortune.
There is a serpent sealed in its sleep, in this abandoned mine.

<What are you exectly talking about.../next>
<You must me out of your mind/Exit>


[next]
I am doing my best to keep it sealed, but my strength is wearing out,
while the serpent is getting stronger every day.
Soon, it will wake up and ascend to the ground.
For now, I have used my sorcery to create a maze,
to keep it from getting away.
However, it's only a matter of time untill it breaks the spell.
Please go and slay the serpent.

<Please show me the way./next1>
<I am not ready for this yet./Exit>


[next1]
Look for a pile of skeletons in this abandoned mine of Snake Valley.
First, I locked all the entrances and exits of the mine,
and blocked the hole, which the serpent has dug,
with the skeletons scattered around me,
since those were the only things I could find at the time.
If you can find this pile of skeletons, you can find your way to the serpent.

<Get me inside the serpent Dungeon./Dmove>
