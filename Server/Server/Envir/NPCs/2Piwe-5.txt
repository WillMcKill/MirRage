You came here to repair your weapon?

We've got most of the weapons

Just choose what you want.

[Sell]
Oh! Nice to hear that!
If you've got some usefull ones, please show me.

<back/Main>

[Repair]
You want the normal repair?
Hmmm, you are having some financial trouble, aren't you?
Anyway, give me the weapon.

<back/Main>

[@SRepair]
Hey guy! You are very lucky...
We have material to do special repairs,
Instead, please keep in mind that the price
would be 3 times higher than normal price.

I really miss my home town,
but i'm not sure I will see it again...
