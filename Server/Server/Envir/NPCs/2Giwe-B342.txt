<Repair/Repair> weapon
<Talk/talk> with Gerald
<Close/Exit>


[Buy]
You want to buy a weapon?
Hmmm, choose what you want.
I assure you they are all fine weapons....
<Back/Main>

[Sell]
We will buy any weapon.
There won't be any rip-off or special but
only fair deal.

<Back/Main>

[Repair]
If you do the normal repair, the durability
of the weapon will drop a bit.
So you still want that?
If you want the special repair, go to Wayne.

<Back/Main>


[@talk]
Castle Gi-Ryoong is built in an isolated area
but the traffic of trade goods is not so light here.
Considering it was originally built
for a purely military use,
It is lucky to have this degree of prosperity here.
However, we always lack the mineral ore to make weapons.
