[Sell]
We'll buy high quality at high price.
But we'll buy at low price meat stained with soil or burned by fire.

[Meathelp]
Meat can be gained from Hens, Deer, Sheep, and Wolves.
To get meat from any of the above, first of all kill the animal.
Once you have killed it, press the ALT button, while left clicking
on the dead body for a few seconds.
You should then see a piece of meat appear in your inventory.
Using magic to kill an animal burns the meat, reducing its quality.
