If you really want to go back to the past, possess a piece
of TimeStone. This piece of stone will help you to
timetravel back to the past. But if your level is below 33,
you can not timetravel even with the stone. I know it is
expensive. If you don't want to buy it try the drops from
monsters. It may take some time but you can save money...
