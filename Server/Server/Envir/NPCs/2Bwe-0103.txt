[Qweapon]
When you buy a store weapon, it has some limits to its performance.
However, weapons acquired from monsters (when they drop them after
being slain), occasionally have a higher rating. If you bring any
such weapons to me, I will usually offer a better price for it.
Remember that an item's price is dependant upon it's condition. If
it has high durability, it's selling price is usually higher.
